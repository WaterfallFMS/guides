A guide for dealing with support

Assess
------

Assess issues as soon as possible.  All issues should be assessed the day they arrive; unless they arrive at or near EOB.

Assess each issue according to [this](https://basecamp.com/1765274/projects/331000-process-and/documents/4284919-dealing-with).


### Feature Requests

Inform senior dev of Feature requests via Campfire (prefered) or Email.


Bugs (Sent to pivotal)
----------------------

You may not be the person fixing the bug so add any additional information to the bug that was discovered during assessment.

### Fail fast debugging

Before "fixing" the bug reproduce the bug locally.  Once the issue is reproducable, write a test.

If other tests start to fail, fix them as well.

### End of sprint effort estimates

Any bug started near the end of a sprint should be estimated for the purpose of planning.  Once estimated inform a senior Dev.  They will decide if the bug is be completed within the current sprint.
